# axolotl

> This is not a Minecraft launcher, but it can launch Minecraft.

## Experimental

This isn't meant to be a useable product or anything serious.

I might try to make it nice someday, if the mood strikes, or if anyone asks for it.

## Usage

```sh
axolotl 1.17.1
```

Authenticates, downloads, and launches some version of the game.

It tries to share the official launcher's folder (.minecraft) for assets/libraries/versions. Saves, session, options, etc. are saved in the current working directory.
